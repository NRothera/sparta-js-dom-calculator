## Difficulties

I found this a pretty hard one to start. I'm pretty new to DOM so there were a lot of mistakes at first, sometimes very frustrating ones.

I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to turn my array with all the values and operators stored into a workable calculation. I got desperate enough to try putting together a bunch of for loops and checking them against a separate number array and operator array, and pushing values into yet another array which got hugely complex and brain wrecking very fast. A quick google showed me JavaScript had eval.....

## Good things

After a bit of time things started to make more sense and got a lot smoother and easier. Now that I've finished the whole task seems a lot more simple.
